            "1. Manufacturing Locations: Tesla's manufacturing facilities are located in California, Nevada, Texas, China, and Germany. They also have plans for future sites such as Mexico. Tesla's active production models are produced at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Texas. On the other hand, GM has announced plans to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with production starting in 2025. GM also has a facility in Canada (CAMI Assembly) and is producing battery cells through a joint venture in Warren, Ohio; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Lansing, Michigan.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Production Methods: Tesla focuses on cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and localized procurement and manufacturing to make their vehicles affordable. They also aim to improve their vehicles' performance and functionality through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features. GM, on the other hand, is investing in their propulsion stamping and components plants to support EV production. They also plan to mass-produce battery cells for their EVs through a joint venture.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Safety Standards: The text does not provide specific information on the safety standards followed by Tesla and GM in their vehicles.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Key Differences and Similarities: Both Tesla and GM are investing heavily in the production of electric vehicles and are focusing on improving their manufacturing processes and capacities. They are also both facing competition from established and new automobile manufacturers entering the electric vehicle market. However, Tesla seems to be more focused on cost reduction and innovation strategies, while GM is investing in their existing facilities and partnerships to support EV production. Tesla also appears to be more focused on integrating artificial intelligence into their vehicles.\n",
